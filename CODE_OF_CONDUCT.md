TL;DR: Don't be an asshole.

Our goal with this project is to provide a safe, harassment-free space to be ourselves. The majority of us are queer and/or neurodivergent, and we just want to have fun together and talk about our shared interest: our belief that Taylor Swift is queer. This obviously means no:
- homophobia
	- lesbophobia
	- biphobia
- transphobia
- racism
- ableism
- other forms of bigotry
