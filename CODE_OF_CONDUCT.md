TL;DR: Don't be an asshole.

- Our goal with this project is to provide a safe, harassment-free space to be ourselves. The majority of us are queer and/or neurodivergent, and we just want to have fun together and talk about our shared interest: our belief that Taylor Swift is queer. This obviously means no:
	- homophobia
		- lesbophobia
		- biphobia
	- transphobia
	- racism
	- ableism
	- gaylorphobia (new word I made up)
		- You are in a gaylor-exclusive space. If you come into this space specifically to aggravate the people here, you will simply be removed without explanation. This includes but is not limited to:
			- Saying that Taylor is straight.
			- Calling us delusional, insane, etc or otherwise saying that we're mentally ill in some way (and therefore not worthy of respect, in your mind ðŸ™„).
				- technically this falls under ableism, but I feel like most hetlors don't even realize that, so I felt the need to specify it here.
				- Telling us to "touch grass".
	- other forms of bigotry
	- on that note, **please don't use slurs you can't reclaim.**

- It should be a place to have **constructive** discussions, so please try to avoid full-blown arguments. 
	- Give and take constructive criticism *gracefully*.
	- Approach things with an open mind - we have no idea what (if any) theories are true, with no way to prove them either way.
		- If you believe you have proof that a theory is false, you can bring it up to them (if they're open to it), but don't be rude about it. Think of it as another piece of constructive criticism.
	- Try not to present yourself as an authority on a subject (in regards to gaylor). We actually *know* very little about this. Theories are just that - theories.
	- Infighting in general is kind of pointless, we're all here for the same reason! Acknowledge (or not) that you disagree and move on to something you actually like.
- Keep things lighthearted! Queer history is very important (and often relevant to us), but it can get quite somber. A little joke can go a long way.
- Avoid using trigger words often used by hetlors, especially in a negative way. Joking about being delusional is fine, but keep in mind that it might make modding a bit harder because I have to read the whole message to figure out what you meant by it.
- Make it a habit to use tone indicators, especially when your message is ambiguous. A lot of us are autistic and can't figure out when people are joking or not (even if you aren't, some stuff just doesn't translate well through text).
	- Emojis also help with this!
- Please don't engage with hetlors of they do manage to make their way in here, just block them and send it to me. Responding only gives them what they want and inflames them more. Then if the whole situation blows up, more people are not only aware of it, but possibly involved, and I have more comments to delete, etc. This isn't Twitter.
