**Tayliz** is the name of a "ship" involving [[../people/taylor-swift|Taylor Swift]] and [[../people/liz-huett|Liz Huett]]. Liz and Taylor first met in Taylor's meet & greet line, where Taylor advised Liz to move to Nashville if she wanted to be a singer (which she did a couple years later). Later, Liz was a backup singer in Taylor's band, having officially joined in April of 2009. They appeared to get close very quickly, even sharing a hotel room (and possibly a bed!?) per a post from Taylor in May. Liz is prominent in many of Taylor's tour vlogs from this time, where they seem to be very close "friends".
