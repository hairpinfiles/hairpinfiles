**Kaylor** is the name of a "ship" involving [[data/people/taylor-swift|Taylor Swift]] and [[data/people/karlie-kloss|Karlie Kloss]]. The two became "best friends" in 2013 and were inseparable for several years, before they just... stopped publicly hanging out in 2018-2019. In March of 2014, they went on a trip to Big Sur together, and both posted several pictures taken on the trip to Instagram and Twitter. Later that summer, Taylor moved to New York City, where Karlie allegedly had a room in Taylor's apartment even though her own was only blocks away.

In the [[tags/gaylor|#gaylor]] community, Karlie is often credited as having inspired all of the love and breakup songs from [[data/albums/reputation|reputation]], [[data/albums/lover|Lover]], [[data/albums/folklore|folklore]], [[data/albums/evermore|evermore]], and [[data/albums/midnights|Midnights]]. However the latter 3 are less clear, as _folklore_ and _evermore_ are mainly fictionalized stories and she described _Midnights_ as "sleepless nights scattered throughout her life". However, there are still a few from those albums which directly reference themes she has used for Karlie in the past, and they are generally regarded as canonical.

## Themes

- **sunshine**: In the "Best Best Friend" video interview with Taylor and Karlie from Vogue in 2015, they were asked to describe each other as an emoji. Taylor picked the sunshine (☀️) for Karlie, and continued this metaphor of Karlie as the sun or sunshine throughout her discography. Devastatingly, it mainly shows up in post-breakup songs, such as [[data/songs/hoax|hoax]], [[data/songs/coney-island|coney island]], [[data/songs/midnight-rain|Midnight Rain]], and [[data/songs/hits-different|Hits Different]].
- **gold**: Similarly to how Karlie _is_ the sunshine, she's also gold. In songs like [[data/songs/end-game|End Game]], [[data/songs/daylight|Daylight]] (golden like daylight, aka sunshine), [[data/songs/invisible-string|invisible string]], [[data/songs/coney-island|coney island]], and last but certainly not least, [[data/songs/gold-rush|gold rush]].
- **New York**: Karlie is the one who convinced Taylor to move to New York City, rather than London. They spent a lot of time there together - allegedly Karlie even had a room in Taylor's apartment even though her own was only blocks away. Taylor was photographed many times in the summer of 2014 going through the gate of Karlie's garden ([[data/songs/cruel-summer|Cruel Summer]], anyone?). Other times they were papped together just walking down the street on their way to a restaurant, cafe, or bookstore. These are some of the most blatant references Taylor has made, and among them: [[data/songs/cornelia-street|Cornelia Street]] (the street her apartment was on), [[data/songs/false-god|False God]], [[data/songs/daylight|Daylight]], [[data/songs/hoax|hoax]], and [[data/songs/maroon|Maroon]].
