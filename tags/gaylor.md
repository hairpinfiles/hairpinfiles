**Gaylor** is a term that refers to the idea of the [[../people/taylor-swift|Taylor Swift]] being queer, as well as a believer in the theory (plural "gaylors"). The name originates from combining the name "Taylor" and the word "gay", reminiscent of "ship" names. It's the foundation of this wiki, so if you don't believe it or are at least curious, why are you here? (if it's just to be mean, get out)

Anyway - gaylors are generally a pretty diverse group. In terms of demographics, sure, but also in opinion & belief. There are those who believe she's a lesbian, bisexual, or don't have an opinion on which label she uses or doesn't use. Whether she dated [[../people/lily-donaldson|Lily Donaldson]] ("tily"), [[../people/zoe-kravitz|Zoe Kravitz]], etc or not is a tossup from person to person. Some believe she's still with [[../people/karlie-kloss|Karlie Kloss]], and others that she never dated Karlie at all and it was a cover-up for her relationship with [[../people/dianna-agron|Dianna Agron]] (known as late-stage kaylor and late-stage swiftgron, respectively). There are also plenty of people who don't care about muses at all, and prefer to focus just on the queer themes themselves!

The point is, there are a lot of different people here. Basically the only thing that _all_ gaylors believe is that she's queer - beyond that, you'll find just about any combination of opinions you can think of.
