**Swiftgron** is the name of the "ship" involving [[people/taylor-swift|Taylor Swift]] and [[people/dianna-agron|Dianna Agron]]. They were first seen together publicly in September of 2011 (introduced by a mutual friend, possibly [[people/ashley-avignone|Ashley Avignone]]), but likely didn't start dating until the following spring. They seemed to be on and off for a while, possibly breaking up a couple of times before they break it off for good. It's unclear at what point they were officially over, or if there was one - Taylor described the song [[songs/style|Style]] as being about “that one person who you feel like might interrupt your wedding and be like ‘don’t do it, cause we’re not over yet’ I think everybody as that one person who kind of floats in and out of their life and the narrative is never truly over.” The only thing that actually seemed to be able to kill swiftgron was [[tags/kaylor|#kaylor]], at the end of 2013/start of 2014.

She is often credited as the muse for several songs on [[albums/red|Red]], as well as most of [[albums/1989|1989]].

## Themes & Motifs
- **Alice in Wonderland**: Dianna was obsessed with it - her Tumblr blog was themed, and the url was *felldowntherabbithole*. She also had a tattoo with a reference on it (the quote "we're all mad here" from the book), which she got removed after the release of [[albums/1989|1989]]. This, of course, leads us to the song [[songs/wonderland|Wonderland]] - about as straightforward as she could get without naming her. [[songs/long-story-short|long story short]] references Alice in Wonderland as well.
- **143**: This is not so much in Taylor's music, but it's still worth noting. Dianna and Taylor apparently used this number as a code with each-other, and it means "I love you". After [[tags/kaylor|#kaylor]] did their Big Sur recreation Vogue shoot, Dianna tweeted this:

  It's become sort of a [[tags/gaylor|#gaylor]] inside joke to use the bitmoji as a reaction to things.
