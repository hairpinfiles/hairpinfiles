**Karlie Elizabeth Kloss** (born August 3, 1992) is an American fashion model. Vogue Paris declared her one of the "top 30 models of the 2000s" when she was 17. Kloss was a Victoria's Secret Angel from 2013 until 2015; she resigned to study at New York University. Models.com has said that Kloss "represents the gold standard of modellingâ€”a girl with the look, the poise, and the drive to take things to the next level", and she ranks on their "New Supers" and "Money Girl" lists. By 2019, she had appeared on 40 international Vogue covers.

Outside of modelling, Kloss has an interest in technology and has founded the "Kode with Klossy" camp, which aims to get young girls interested in STEM fields. In 2019, Kloss became the host of the reality competition television series Project Runway. She has signed with several top modelling agencies throughout her career including Elite Model Management, Next Management, IMG Models, and The Society Management.
