# Welcome to the Gaylor Vault repository!
This wiki isn't really meant to be browsed on GitHub, though you're welcome to. It'll mainly be lacking in navigation through wikilinks. 

But otherwise, try the [site.](https://gaylor-wiki.github.io) If you want to learn GitHub specifically, [this page](https://gaylor-wiki.github.io/using-github) should be helpful for you. Or you might want to clone the repo locally and browse it in [Obsidian?](https://obsidian.md) There's a [guide](https://gaylor-wiki.github.io/using-obsidian) for that too.

If you're looking for the repo where the site is actually *built,* you can find it [here.](https://github.com/gaylor-wiki/gaylor-wiki.github.io)
