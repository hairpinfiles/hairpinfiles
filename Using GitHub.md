# Using GitHub
GitHub is a place to keep [[Using Git|Git]] repositories - it's usually used for code, really can be useful with any project made up of mainly text files. Good news for us, that describes our Vault perfectly!

You'll need an account, of course. I assume you can find the button that says "Sign Up"? Click it and follow along. I don't mean to be blunt, but if you can't figure out how to create an account, then I'm not sure what you *could* do, and there's no way for me to help you with that. ðŸ¤·

Anyway - there's probably something you're looking for here. If you're new and don't know what you're doing, try [[#Issues]].

## Issues
Issues are sort of like a big bin of tasks for the whole vault. They represent **things to be done.** Take for example, [#2](https://github.com/dykeaura/issues/2) (the one I'm working on right now!) 
- It's called "Write a contribution guide" 
- It's assigned to *dykeaura* (me)
- it has the [[#Labels]] "addition" and "meta"

With a keen eye, you may have also noticed how I linked to it, with "#2". The 2 here refers to the issue *id*, and you can also find it next to the title, a little greyed out. In Obsidian, you have to manually link to it (actually, I have a regex set up to do it automatically, but you don't want to hear about that), but on GitHub, it does it automatically. These ids are not only for the issues, but they are shared with [[#Pull Requests]] and [[#Discussions]]. Don't worry about those yet.

When we're done with an issue (which usually means we finished the task, or decided we wouldn't do it at all), we can close it. This is basically just like checking it off our list - mostly a cosmetic thing and doesn't really have an effect other than let us filter it and help us than see what's going on at a glance, so we can move on and work on something else. It turns the icon of the issue (a circle with a dot in the middle) from *green* to *purple*.

### Labels
Labels are sort of like categories for the issues. If there's a lot of them (large projects often have thousands open at a time!), it can be difficult to parse through them all just by title and description alone. So labels mainly provide a filtering utility, as well as give us some other information about the issue before we click on it, sort of like seeing tags on an article. All labels have descriptions that should appear when you hover over them, or you could view all of them and their descriptions [here](https://github.com/dykeaura/gaylor-vault/labels).
