# Welcome to the Gaylor Vault!
This is a community-run wiki, written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)-flavoured markdown and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/dykeaura/gaylor-vault) (private currently). It's also published to [Github Pages](https://dykeaura.github.io/gaylor-wiki) using a plugin for Obsidian called [Github Publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher).

That may have sounded like a jumble of garbage to you, and I'm sorry. You're probably here because of our, um... *topic of interest*, gaylor.

Well then, you might be looking for a page about miss [[Taylor Swift]] herself, or perhaps one of the "ships", hmm? [[Kaylor]], [[Swiftgron]], [[Tayliz]]... 

If there's something specific you're looking for, you could try the search. Or perhaps it doesn't exist yet, and in that case I would suggest visiting the [[CONTRIBUTING]] page, if you'd like to try adding it yourself.

Before you interact with others, however, I implore you to read the [[CODE_OF_CONDUCT]], it will help you make better decisions about what is appropriate to say or do in this space.
