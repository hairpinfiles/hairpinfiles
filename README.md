# Welcome to the Gaylor Vault!
This is a community-run wiki, written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)-flavoured markdown and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/dykeaura/gaylor-vault) (private currently). It's also published to [Github Pages](https://dykeaura.github.io/gaylor-wiki) using a plugin for Obsidian called [Github Publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher).

That may have sounded like a jumble of garbage to you, and I'm sorry. You're probably here because of our, um... *topic of interest*, gaylor.

Well then, you might be looking for a page about miss [[Taylor Swift]] herself, or perhaps one of the "ships", hmm? [[Kaylor]], [[Swiftgron]], [[Tayliz]]... If there's something specific you're looking for, you could try the search.
